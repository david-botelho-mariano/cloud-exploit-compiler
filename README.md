# Cloud exploit compiler

This GitHub repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process of downloading, compiling, and uploading a C exploit program within an Ubuntu 16.04 container environment. The workflow triggers on push events and performs the following tasks: setting up an Ubuntu 16.04 container, downloading a specific C exploit code from a given URL, compiling it into an executable, and finally uploading the compiled executable as an artifact to GitHub.
