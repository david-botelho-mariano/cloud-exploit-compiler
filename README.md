# Cloud exploit compiler

[linux.yml](https://github.com/david-botelho-mariano/cloud-exploit-compiler/blob/main/.github/workflows/linux.yml)

-  The workflow triggers on push events and performs the following tasks: setting up an Ubuntu 16.04 container, downloading a specific C exploit code from a given URL, compiling it into an executable, and finally uploading the compiled executable as an artifact to GitHub. 

[windows.yaml](https://github.com/david-botelho-mariano/cloud-exploit-compiler/blob/main/.github/workflows/windows.yaml)

-  The workflow begins by cloning the CoercedPotato repository and setting up the MSBuild environment. It then compiles the exploit solution using MSBuild in Release configuration. After the build process, the workflow runs the compiled exploit with the --help flag to ensure it was built correctly and to display its help information. Finally, it uploads the compiled executable as a build artifact.
